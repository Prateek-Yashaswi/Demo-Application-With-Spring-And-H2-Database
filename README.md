# Demo-Application-With-Spring-And-H2-Database

##Spring
Spring is a lightweight framework. It can be thought of as a framework of frameworks because it provides support to various frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, etc. The framework, in broader sense, can be defined as a structure where we find solution of the various technical problems.
The Spring framework comprises several modules such as IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, ORM, WEB MVC etc.

##H2 Database 
H2 is an open-source lightweight Java database. It can be embedded in Java applications or run in the client-server mode. H2 database can be configured to run as in-memory database, which means that data will not persist on the disk.

In This Project I Have Used Constructor Based Dependency Injection Which Is One Of The Way To Implement IOC (Inversion Of Control).
